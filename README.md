# Go-Daddy-Microbusiness-Density-Forecasting

Microbusiness density refers to the concentration or number of microbusinesses in a particular geographic area. A microbusiness is typically defined as a small business with fewer than 10 employees, and it may include sole proprietorships, partnerships, or small corporations. Microbusinesses are a critical component of the economy, but they often lack the resources and expertise needed to make informed decisions about expansion and investment. By providing accurate density forecasts, GoDaddy could empower small business owners to make data-driven decisions about growth and expansion, ultimately supporting the health of the microbusiness sector as a whole. In addition to its potential business benefits, the development of a microbusiness density forecasting tool can also have broader social and economic implications. Microbusinesses are an important driver of job creation and economic growth, particularly in underserved communities.
